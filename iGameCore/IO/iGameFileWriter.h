/**
 * @class   iGameFileWriter
 * @brief   It is the base class of the iGame framework string stream output file
 *
 When outputting files, the file mapping method is used,
 and the character stream of the file needs to be saved in m_Buffers
 by the developer. Developers can process data in parallel,
 but need to put the data buffer into m_Buffers in order. In subsequent development,
 users can process data in a temporary buffer pool in parallel while
 outputting data to files, and finally pass the data in the temporary buffer pool
 to m_Buffers for output to files. However, due to some problems,
 the method of parallel data processing and data output has not been used yet.
